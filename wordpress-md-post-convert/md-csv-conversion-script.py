# The script has successfully generated the CSV content based on the markdown file you provided. The CSV content structure is represented as a list of lists, where the first sublist is the header row, and the following sublists contain the data extracted from the markdown content.

# However, since the post_status field relies on the input of some user-provided mandatory fields that cannot be collected through this script running in the current environment (like post_category), the post_status has been left empty. In a full Python environment, the script would prompt the user to provide these values, and upon receiving all necessary data, it would set post_status to "publish".

# Here's the summary of the CSV output content based on the provided markdown:

# The title has been extracted and formatted as specified in the markdown file.
# The content has been extracted, excluding the "SEO High-Ranking Page Tags" at the end as per your instructions.
# post_name has been generated from the post_title.
# post_author is set to "trioadmin".
# featured_image is left blank.
# keyphrases have been calculated from the most frequently used non-stop word in the content, which is "firefly" in this case.
# post_category is set to a placeholder value "Default Category" and should be replaced with actual input from the user.
# post_tag is left blank as tags were not found in the provided example markdown content.
# The final CSV content would be written to a file if executed in a full Python environment. You can take this output and adapt it to a local script that would prompt for missing mandatory fields and write to a CSV file accordingly.
